- Refine barrier mechanism, perhaps with a combining tree technique

- Add possible NUMA alignment parameter to assess the impact of
  remote versus local accesses to data structures. The parameter
  can be a simple boolean. If set to true, all memory allocations
  for the insert stage will be performed to node local memory by each
  thread, thus since the kthreads are bound to CPUs round-robin the
  tree nodes will be distributed among the NUMA nodes evenly. Then,
  on the erase/lookup stage, with the NUMA-aware parameter set,
  each kthread will randomly choose offsets only within the range of
  the NUMA node to which its CPU belongs, thus operations will remain
  in local memory, else completely random offsets will be used as in 
  the current implementation.
